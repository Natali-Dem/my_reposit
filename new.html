						Bengaluru: The Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru, N S Megharik, has said the police have not imposed Section 144 in the city.

In a tweet today, the CoP urged people not to panic as Section 144 has not been imposed on Bengaluru.

The police had to take to the Twitter route as rumours spread in the city and elsewhere that the prohibitory section had been enforced in Bengaluru.

'We urge to all Bengalurians to not pay heed to rumours. Stay calm and do not panic: #Bengaluru Police #CauveryProtests' said another tweet of the city police.

Trouble between Karnataka and Tamilnadu that had been simmering ever since the Supreme Court ordered the release of Cauvery water for the lower riparian State, and Karnataka reluctantly agreed to comply with the order. The flashpoint was a group of people bashing up a Tamilnadu youth yesterday for his alleged derogatory comments on social media about Kannada actors/actresses supporting their State in the Cauvery row.

There were retaliatory strikes in Tamilnadu, with the Woodlands hotel in Chennai being made a target this morning and tourist vehicles in Rameswaram being attacked.
